# Sample retrieval test cases (Legixo sample corpus)

**Purpose:** Optional **gold-style** questions and answers for the **fictional** markdown corpus (`01_` … `06_` files). Give this file to candidates so they can **check retrieval and grounding** against a known target.

**Important**

- All facts are **made up** for the exercise.
- **Exact chunk IDs** depend on how the candidate chunks text; we list **source files** they should cite.
- Answers may be **phrased differently**; judge whether the **same facts** appear and citations point to the **right documents**.
